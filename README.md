# INTRODUCTION

flask-example4 is a simple example flask app that uses authentication.  This is not designed to be pretty, or clever.  This is not nearly finished. 

- learning Flask.
- kicking off your new project.
## PRESUMPTION

- python is installed
- pip is installed
- guinicorn is installed

## INSTALLATION

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/tlh45342/flask-example4.git
cd flask-example4
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

## SIDEBAR: Notes for creating a service for Linux based distributions

I am putting my notes here now - because I will use them.  Consider these random notes used to implement the Flask APP as a service.

To create a service entry cd /etc/systemd/system
Create a file that looks something like is found in the following block.
As much as I hate assumptions - you will need to edit this to your tastes and for your environment.

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/flask-example4.service
[Unit]
Description=flask-example4

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/mnt/opt/flask-example4/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 server:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

The key commands for reference are: 

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start flask4.service
sudo systemctl restart flask4.service
sudo systemctl stop flask4.service
```
